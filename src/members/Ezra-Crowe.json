  "bio": "Hello! I’m Ezra. I’m the current treasurer of Obiesource and project leader for the Discord bot. I’m a CS and Philosophy major with a minor in Cognitive Science. I’m also the club cyber security specialist. If you’re interested in my ongoing projects or just want to be filled in on what I’ve found so far, I’d be happy to share! In my free time, I practice trumpet (I’m not a con student but have played since 4th grade), play water polo, or do a little board/video gaming. I love to help people, even more so if it means finding creative ways to break a system ;)"
